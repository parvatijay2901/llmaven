# LLMaven

This project's scientific goal is to create open, transparent and useful AI-based
software for scientific research. We propose building a tool library, named LLMaven, using a
Generative AI approach, specifically Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based LLM. We
will use RAG as a means of extending LLMs for data that has privacy/IP concerns that is cost
effective for individual researchers who do not have the resources to develop their own models
(or purchase expensive equipment). LLMaven will leverage publicly available diverse datasets
