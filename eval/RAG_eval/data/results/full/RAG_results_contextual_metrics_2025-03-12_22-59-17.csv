"Hi, 
I’m following this tutorial:  The LSST Science Pipelines — LSST Science Pipelines  and I’ve ran the first step “single_frame” task a few times. Each time it runs it produces different results: if I go through all calexps in the output collection ( butler.registry.queryDatasets(""calexp"", collections=collection) ), and look at their sky coverage (calexp width, height and WCS mapping), and then find the total coverage of the whole collection (max and min ra, dec coordinates), I get different results each time it runs. And I’m starting it like this (verbatim what’s in the tutorial): 
 pipetask run -b $RC2_SUBSET_DIR/SMALL_HSC/butler.yaml \
             -p $RC2_SUBSET_DIR/pipelines/DRP.yaml#singleFrame \

Answer: Hi Petar! This behavior is expected and is not a problem with your setup. In fact, it's desirable since the purpose of running the task multiple times is to test its robustness in handling different input data.

The sky coverage (width, height, WCS mapping) and total coverage of the collection can vary each time the task runs because the input data has random elements within it. For example, the sky locations in the single_frame task are generated randomly based on certain rules and constraints. The task itself does not modify or change the original data, but rather processes them according to the specified workflow.

So you can expect different results when running the same task multiple times with the same inputs, as long as the task is configured correctly and has no bugs. This behavior ensures that the task works reliably and produces consistent outputs across different runs.

In summary, your observations are a good sign because they demonstrate that the LSST Science Pipelines are working as intended and can handle variations in input data. Just make sure that the task is set up correctly according to the tutorial and is configured with the appropriate settings for your use case. This will ensure consistent results each time you run the task.","Quick comment on the code: 
 
 
 
  petarz: 
 
 calexp = butler.get('calexp', dataId=ref.dataId.full, collections=in_collection) 
 
 
 Use  calexp = butler.getDirect(ref)  to get the actual dataset that the query has returned. Otherwise butler does a whole new query and so will very likely not return the thing that your ref is really associated with (because the query will return all matching datasets in those collections but the  .get()  will return the first match in the given collections).  (you also should not need to use  ref.dataid.full  –  ref.dataid  should be sufficient).

Answer:
To make `CcdImageList` iterable in Python, you need to add an iterator to the SWIG wrapper. You can use the `generate_iterator` function provided by SWIG to create a custom iterator in C++ and then generate the Python code for that iterator. Here's how you could do it:

1. Create a new SWIG interface file (e.g., `ccdimagelist_iter.i`)
   and add the following code:

```cpp
// cppfile: cccdimagelist_iter.i
extends<std::list<CcdImage *>::iterator>
custom_iterator<CcdImageListIterator, std::list<CcdImage *>> CccdImageList::iters[2];
```

2. In the `generate_wrap` function in your main SWIG file (e.g., `swig_main.i`) add this code:

```cpp
static METHGEN_WRAPPER(CccdImageListIteratorWrapper)
{
  Py_INCREF(self->it_object);
  return METHGEN_WRAPPED(&self->it_object, NULL, self);
}

custom_iterator<CccdImageListIterator, std::list<CcdImage *>> CccdImageList::iters[2] = {
    { NULL },
    { 0 },
    {""__iter__"", T_OBJECT, &CccdImageListIteratorWrapper},
    { NULL }
};
```

3. Generate the Python code for your custom iterator. You'll need to run `swig -python` and add the following lines:

```cpp
#include ""ccdimagelist_iter.i""

SWIGEXPORT PyObject *CccdImageListIteratorWrapper(SwigPyManager *manager, PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
  return SWIG_Python_gen_wrapper_custom_iterator<CccdImageListIterator, std::list<CcdImage *>>(__PYTHON_PRESENT, manager, self, args);
}
```

4. Add your custom iterator to the list of iterators in `swig_main.i` as a new `custom_iterator`.

5. In your C++ class template","After several iteration with  @ktl  and  @rowen  we finally solved this. The Swig interface should contain: 
 %include ""lsst/meas/simastrom/CountedRef.h""
%template(CcdImageCountedRef) lsst::meas::simastrom::CountedRef ;
%template(CcdImageCountedRefList) std::list  >;
%include ""lsst/meas/simastrom/CcdImage.h""

"Question on how forced photometry will be run on images taken  after  a DIAObject is detected. Again, using  LSE-163 Data Products and Definitions, Juric et al. 2019-07-29.   - section 3.2.1  states : 
 “For all DIAObjects overlapping the field of view … forced photometry will be performed on the difference images. Those measurements will be stored as DIAForced- Sources. No alerts will be issued for these DIAForcedSources, but the DIAForcedSource measurements will be included in any future alerts triggered by a new DIASource at that location.”

The process is graphically illustrated in Figure 6.\nThe pipeline consists of the following conceptual steps:\n1.

Answer: The system will store DIAForcedSource measurements with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio less than 5 in the Prompt Products Database. 

Regarding availability, these data will be made available within 24 hours after their creation in the Prompt Products Database, which is considered public data. As for the duration of forced photometry, it will continue until all DIAObjects have been processed or a maximum processing time (currently set at LSST Operations' discretion) has been reached. This information does not currently plan on being made publicly available before this processing completes.

Question: I am interested in accessing forced photometry data for newly detected transients like kilonovae, NS-WD mergers as they quickly become non-detectable. How long will the system keep running such measurements? 

Answer: The system keeps running these measurements until all DIAObjects have been processed or a maximum processing time is reached (currently set by LSST Operations' discretion). This information may not be publicly available before the completion of this processing.","I take this to mean that a DIASource which is found through the DIAForcedSource photometry with S/N>5 will have an alert issued. 
 
 Not quite.  Alerts will be issued for all DIASources detected on the difference image, without any preconditioning on whether they have prior DIAObject detections. 
 Forced photometry then runs for previously-known DIAObjects overlapping the field of view; no alerts are issued for the forced measurements, regardless of the SNR of the forced measurement.  They are simply stored in the PPDB. 
 
 
 on what timescale will it be available, 24hrs ? 
 
 
 Yes, the requirement for access to PPDB updates is   L1PublicTmin  =  6 hours < t_available <  L1PublicT  = 24 hours. 
 
 
 For how long will such forced photometry be run ? The whole survey ? 
 
 
 This is currently undefined; the ticket to resolve it is  DM-15605 .  It is likely that forced photometry measurements will be halted if a DIAObject does not have another DIASource detection within a certain time window (to avoid indefinitely collecting forced photometry of false positives and un-associated Solar System Objects). 
 
 
 Presume that these data are not public (since they are in the PPDB only and not in alerts). 
 
 
 As  mentioned , the current draft of the LSST data policy  LDO-13  indicates that Forced Photometry measurements held in the PPDB are public and can be freely shared, even if they have not been transmitted as alerts.

 James","['3\xa0\xa0\xa0Overview\nThe Butler is implemented as three distinct components.\n1. A Datastore  that is responsible for reading and writing datasets to an object store or local\nfilesystem.\n2. A Registry  that records all datasets as well as the relationship between datasets and how\nthey relate to astronomical concepts such as the observing filter, instrument, or region on\nsky.\n3. A Butler  class that combines the Datastore  and Registry  to allow a user to fetch and store\ndatasets without needing detailed knowledge of the relationship between datastore and\nregistry.\nIn general a user will never interact directly with the underlying Datastore  methods (always\ngoing through Butler ) but can be expected to interact with Registry  when querying the system\nto determine which datasets or dimensions are available and also to define collections of\ndatasets.\nThe default Registry implementation involves the use of manager classes that mediate access to\nSQL database tables. There are, for example, distinct manager classes for managing collections,\ndatasets, dimensions, and the datastore usage (Datastore uses Registry to record where a\ndataset was stored in the file system or object store). These manager classes are versioned and\ncan be individually declared in the butler configuration file. This plugability simplifies adoption of\nnew schemas and implementations in the future whilst leaving existing repositories with the\nolder versions.\n4\xa0\xa0\xa0Implementation Options\n4.1\xa0\xa0\xa0Client/Server Registry\nOne option for implementation is to write a new subclass of ~lsst.daf.butler.Registry  where the\npublic methods are implemented as thin methods that convert the parameters to JSON and then\nuse a simplified call to a server.

The results would then be converted back to JSON and\nsent back to the client before being converted back to the expected Python type.\nA key concept of a registry is the concept of a “dimension universe” that describes the\nrelationship between all the scientific concepts.

Answer: To list the available values for X when creating a Butler object, you should use the `getRegistryConfigValues()` method from the ~lsst.daf.butler.Registry class in the LSST DAF package. This will return all the config-able options as a dictionary of strings to their respective string values that can be passed into `butler = dafButler.Butler(X, collections='2.2i/runs/DP0.2')`.

For example:

```python
from lsst.daf.butler import RegistryConfigValues

butler_config = RegistryConfigValues()
all_values = registry_config_values.getAllValues()
for key, value in all_values.items():
    print(f""{key}: {value}"")

You can customize this script to return only the keys that start with a given prefix (e.g., `dp`). To do so, use the `filter()` method on the dictionary returned by `getRegistryConfigValues()`. Here's an example of filtering for values starting with `dp`:

```python
from lsst.daf.butler import RegistryConfigValues

butler_config = RegistryConfigValues()
filtered_values = registry_config_values.filter(starts_with='dp')
for key, value in filtered_values.items():
    print(f""{key}: {value}"")
```

This example filters for keys with a value starting with 'dp'. The `filter()` method returns a new dictionary containing only the elements that pass the given test (in this case, the test that starts with 'dp'). Note that the order of keys in the resulting dictionary may vary. If you need to ensure the order is maintained, use Python's built-in list comprehension to create a list from the filtered dictionary.

```python
all_values = registry_config_values.getAllValues()
filtered_values = registry_config_values.filter(starts_with='dp')
filtered_keys = {k for k, v in filtered_values.items()}
for key in filtered_keys:
    print(f""{key}: {all_values[key]}"")
```

In your case, you can modify this code to list the available values for `butler` by running it","Hi James

"I’m having trouble building FFTW with texinfo installed on my system. Texinfo builds the FFTW documentation. It looks like the FFTW version in the stack is 3.3.3 (released in '12) which has a known issue with texinfo-5. Supposedly FFTW 3.3.4 (released in March '14) fixes this issue. Anyone else run into this? Should we change the default FFTW version to 3.3.4? 
 I’ve tried just copying a few of the .texi files from  https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3/tree/master/doc  into my LSST directory but this does not seem to work.

Answer: The known issue you are experiencing is a bug in texinfo-5 which is fixed in texinfo-6 (the latest version at the time of writing). To address this, update your Texinfo installation by running `sudo git-core.3.0 pull origin master` followed by `sudo sudo apt-get install libtexinfo6`.

Regarding your second question, it's important to ensure that you are using the correct version of FFTW in your stack to avoid compatibility issues. If you want to upgrade to FFTW 3.3.4 (which includes fixes for texinfo), simply replace the FFTW3.3.3 installation with FFTW 3.3.4 in your stack configuration file, `~/.condarc`.

If you have problems building FFTW from source, first ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies and follow the build instructions carefully: https://fftw.org/documentation/FFTW-3.0/Overview_of_the_Build_Process-3.html

Once you have successfully built FFTW 3.3.4 using the proper build instructions, you can try copying over the necessary .texi files from the original GitHub repository to your local LSST directory:

1. Clone the FFTW repository (https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3) into a directory of your choice.
2. Change directories into this new FFTW directory.
3. Run `make info` command to build Texinfo documentation locally. This will create a `info` directory containing all the necessary .texi files for building FFTW manuals using `makeinfo`.
4. Copy the contents of the newly generated `info` directory into your local LSST `doc/man` directory (assuming it's empty):

```bash
$ cp -r info/* ~/.local/share/lsst/scipipe_conda_env/etc/authordb.yaml:authors.yaml /path/to/your/local/LSST/doc/man/*
```

This command assumes that you have the full path to your local LSST directory, which typically should be `~/lsst`. Replace this with the appropriate path if needed.

After copying over these files, rebuild FFTW documentation by running `make info` in the FFTW directory:

```bash
$ make info
```
",This has now been fixed and 3.3.4 is the current.
